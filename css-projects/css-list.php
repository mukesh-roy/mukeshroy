<li><a href="pseudoclass.php"> Pseudo Elements<span class="not-display-in-dropdown">: Pseudo elements in CSS allow you to add decorative or functional elements to your webpage without modifying the HTML structure.

<li><a href="validation_pseudoclass.php"> Validation with Pseudo Class<span class="not-display-in-dropdown">: CSS pseudo-classes can be used to apply styles based on the validation state of form elements.
